* Emlisp
  Emlisp is my experiment with language implementation,
  features and such things.
  
** Examples
   Few examples of what is implemented now

** todo

   1. Macros
   2. let
   3. progn
   4. self-hosted test framework
   5. tests

** Ideas / Features
   - generalized booleans
   - control that number of , corresponds to number of ` (on grammar level?)
   - object system
   - erlang code generation
   - DONE node-wide shared state?
   - mutable environments?
